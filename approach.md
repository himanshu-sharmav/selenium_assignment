Brief Documentation: Selenium Form Submission and Screenshot Capture
Introduction

This documentation outlines the approach used to automate the submission of a Google Form, capture a screenshot of the confirmation page, and send the screenshot via email using Django. The process involves using Selenium for web automation and Django for email functionality.
Prerequisites

    WebDriver: Ensure the appropriate WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver) is installed and configured.
    Python Packages: Install the required Python packages:

    bash

    pip install selenium django

Approach
1. Setting Up Selenium

    Initialize WebDriver: Set up the Chrome WebDriver to control the browser.
    Open the Google Form: Navigate to the Google Form URL.

2. Form Submission

    Wait for Form to Load: Use WebDriverWait to ensure the form is fully loaded before interacting with it.
    Locate Form Fields: Use XPath expressions to locate each form field based on their attributes (like aria-label).
    Fill Out the Form: Input the required data into each form field.
    Submit the Form: Locate and click the "Submit" button.

3. Capture Screenshot

    Wait for Confirmation Page: Use WebDriverWait to wait until the confirmation message appears.
    Take Screenshot: Capture a screenshot of the confirmation page and save it to a specified path.

4. Sending Email with Django

    Django Setup: Configure Django settings for email.
    Compose Email: Create an email with the required subject, recipients, and attach the screenshot.
    Send Email: Use Django's send_mail function to send the email.
